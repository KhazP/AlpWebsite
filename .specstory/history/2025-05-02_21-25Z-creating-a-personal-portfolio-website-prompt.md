_**Assistant**_

Okay, here is a prompt focusing on the design aspects for recreating the website:

Create a personal portfolio website based on the provided files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `scripts.js`).

**Design Explanation:**

The website utilizes a modern, dark-themed aesthetic with a professional feel, suitable for a tech-savvy translator/localizer.

*   **Color Palette:** Dominated by dark backgrounds (`--background-color`: `#020912ff`, `--background-alt-color`: `#0c1726`) and card backgrounds (`--card-bg-color`: `#112233`). A dark green (`--primary-color`: `#156129`) serves as the primary branding color, used for links, buttons, and accents. A secondary blue (`--accent-color`: `#1a7fbc`) provides highlights. Text is primarily light (`--text-primary-color`: `#f8f9fa`, `--text-secondary-color`: `#ced4da`) for contrast.
*   **Typography:** Headings use the 'Funnel Display' font (`--font-heading`), while body text uses 'Open Sans' or system UI fonts (`--font-main`), creating a clean, readable hierarchy.
*   **Layout:** It employs a responsive design adapting to different screen sizes using media queries. A central container (`.container`) limits content width. Sections are clearly defined with consistent padding and titles. Flexbox and Grid are used for layout, particularly for arranging content side-by-side on larger screens (e.g., hero, about, contact) and for card grids (`.projects-grid`).
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Navbar (`.navbar`):** Fixed to the top, semi-transparent, shrinks and becomes more opaque on scroll (`.scrolled`). Features a logo, centered navigation links (desktop), language switcher, and a hamburger menu for mobile.
    *   **Hero Section (`.hero`):** Full viewport height with an animated "night sky" background (`.night-sky`) featuring shooting stars and twinkling stars. Contains the main heading, subheading, profile image (circular), and a call-to-action button.
    *   **Cards (`.translation-card`, `.project-card`, `.character-infobox`):** Used consistently for displaying projects, translations, and the 'About Me' infobox. Feature dark backgrounds, rounded corners, subtle borders, and hover effects.
    *   **Collapsible Sections (`.collapsible`):** Used in the Experience section, allowing users to expand/collapse content with smooth transitions.
    *   **Buttons (`.btn`):** Styled consistently with the primary green color, rounded corners, and hover effects.
    *   **Forms (`.contact-form`):** Clean input styling with focus states and validation feedback.
*   **Visual Details:** Subtle box shadows are used on cards and the navbar. Transitions (`--transition-medium`, `--transition-fast`) provide smooth feedback on hover/interaction. Font Awesome icons enhance visual cues.

**Goal:** Replicate the website's structure, dark-themed visual design, responsive layout, component styling, animations (like the hero background and scroll animations), and interactive features (language switching, collapsible sections, active nav highlighting) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
