# Now, my dad gave this feedback about my language.  (2025-06-11 00:35:51)

_**User**_

Now, my dad gave this feedback about my language. Please change turkish and english texts talking about myself, according to this:

Bence öyle gayret ediyorum kendimi geliştiriyorum filan iyi bir değil. Yani henüz olmadım yardımlarınızla olacak gibi duyuluyo..

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I've updated the English texts in `ai-chat-section.tsx` to reflect a more confident tone, based on your father's feedback.

Here's a summary of the changes:
*   Phrases emphasizing ongoing learning like "developing skills," "learning to," "gaining experience," "working on proficiency" have been revised to highlight existing capabilities and experiences more directly (e.g., "skills in," "experience in," "proficient with").
*   The overall narrative now focuses more on what Alp *can do* and *has done*, rather than what he is *in the process of learning*.

You'll find these changes in the `initialMessages`, `experienceResponses`, `skillsResponses`, `projectResponses`, `translationResponses`, `localizationResponses`, `technicalTranslationResponses`, `transcreationResponses`, and `educationResponses` constants, as well as the default fallback message in the `handleSubmit` function.

**Important:** This update applies to the English texts defined within the `ai-chat-section.tsx` file. If you have separate files for Turkish translations (e.g., for an i18n library), you'll need to apply similar changes to those files to ensure consistency.

OK. I've updated the AI assistant's responses in `ai-chat-section.tsx` to reflect a more confident tone, emphasizing existing skills and experiences rather than an ongoing learning process.

I've also adjusted the initial greeting and the fallback response to align with this new tone. Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!

I've updated the specified English and Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to convey a more confident and established professional tone. Phrases indicating ongoing skill development have been revised or removed.

dont use words like uzmanlaşmış, I just graduated 4 years ago.

---

_**Assistant**_

OK. I'll revise the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to remove "uzmanlaşmış" and use phrasing that better reflects your experience level.

 
````

````
You're right, "uzmanlaşmış" might imply a level of expertise that doesn't quite fit yet. I've replaced "uzmanlaşmış" with "odaklanmış" (focused on) in the Turkish translations within `language-context.tsx` to better reflect your experience level.

---

_**User**_

ok now check the rest please

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I've reviewed the rest of `language-context.tsx`.

I found a couple of instances in the English translations where the word "specialize" or "specializing" was used, which could imply a similar level of expertise as "uzmanlaşmış." I'll adjust these to better reflect your experience, similar to how we changed the Turkish text.

Here are the changes I'll make:

1.  In the English translation for `about.who.description`, I'll change "I specialize in video game localization..." to "I focus on video game localization...".
2.  In the English translation for `footer.description`, I'll change "Translator & Localizer specializing in video game localization..." to "Translator & Localizer focusing on video game localization...".

The case study descriptions and other sections appear to use language that is appropriate for someone who graduated 4 years ago and is building their career.

 
````

````
OK. I've reviewed the rest of the English translations in `language-context.tsx` and made adjustments to ensure consistency with the tone and experience level we've discussed. Specifically, I've changed "specialize" or "specializing" to "focus on" or "focusing on" in relevant descriptions.

please remove hero title in turkish, and add A for it in english

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I'll make those changes.

For the Turkish version, I'll remove the hero titles.
For the English version, I'll add "A" to the translator title.

Here's how I'll update `language-context.tsx`:
 
````

````
OK, I've made the following changes to `language-context.tsx`:

*   Removed the Turkish translations for `hero.title.translator` and `hero.title.localizer`.
*   Added "A" to the English translation for `hero.title.translator`, so it now reads "A TRANSLATOR &".

I see the issue. The Turkish hero titles are still showing even though I set them to empty strings. Let me check how the hero component handles these translations and fix this properly. Let me check the correct hero section file that's being used: Let me continue reading the hero section to see how the titles are being used: I can see the issue! The component is looking for `t("hero.title.a")` but we only have `hero.title.translator` and `hero.title.localizer` in the translations. Let me check if there's a `hero.title.a` translation defined, and also look at how the desktop version handles the titles: Now I need to check if there's a `hero.title.a` translation defined or if it's missing. Let me search for it in the language context: I see the problem! The component is looking for `t("hero.title.a")` which doesn't exist in our translations. We need to add this translation key. Based on the component structure, it looks like `hero.title.a` should be the "A" part for English and empty for Turkish. 
````

````
Perfect! I've fixed the issue by adding the missing `hero.title.a` translation key to both English and Turkish versions in `language-context.tsx`. 

Now:
- For English: It will show "A TRANSLATOR & LOCALIZER" 
- For Turkish: All title parts will be empty strings, so no titles will be displayed

This should resolve the display issue you were seeing in the screenshots.
