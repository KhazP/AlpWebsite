# Now, my dad gave this feedback about my language.  (2025-06-11 00:35:51)

Now, my dad gave this feedback about my language. Please change turkish and english texts talking about myself, according to this:

Bence öyle gayret ediyorum kendimi geliştiriyorum filan iyi bir değil. Yani henüz olmadım yardımlarınızla olacak gibi duyuluyo..

Okay, I've updated the English texts in `ai-chat-section.tsx` to reflect a more confident tone, based on your father's feedback.

Here's a summary of the changes:
*   Phrases emphasizing ongoing learning like "developing skills," "learning to," "gaining experience," "working on proficiency" have been revised to highlight existing capabilities and experiences more directly (e.g., "skills in," "experience in," "proficient with").
*   The overall narrative now focuses more on what Alp *can do* and *has done*, rather than what he is *in the process of learning*.

You'll find these changes in the `initialMessages`, `experienceResponses`, `skillsResponses`, `projectResponses`, `translationResponses`, `localizationResponses`, `technicalTranslationResponses`, `transcreationResponses`, and `educationResponses` constants, as well as the default fallback message in the `handleSubmit` function.

**Important:** This update applies to the English texts defined within the `ai-chat-section.tsx` file. If you have separate files for Turkish translations (e.g., for an i18n library), you'll need to apply similar changes to those files to ensure consistency.

OK. I've updated the AI assistant's responses in `ai-chat-section.tsx` to reflect a more confident tone, emphasizing existing skills and experiences rather than an ongoing learning process.

I've also adjusted the initial greeting and the fallback response to align with this new tone. Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!

I've updated the specified English and Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to convey a more confident and established professional tone. Phrases indicating ongoing skill development have been revised or removed.

dont use words like uzmanlaşmış, I just graduated 4 years ago.

_**Assistant**_

OK. I'll revise the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to remove "uzmanlaşmış" and use phrasing that better reflects your experience level.

You're right, "uzmanlaşmış" might imply a level of expertise that doesn't quite fit yet. I've replaced "uzmanlaşmış" with "odaklanmış" (focused on) in the Turkish translations within `language-context.tsx` to better reflect your experience level.
