Lastly fix the View Game on Steam under battle talent. It's not where it should be, it's stuck to the edge.

### Solution for Fixing the "View Game on Steam" Button Position

I'll fix the positioning of the "View Game on Steam" button under the Battle Talent section by correcting the HTML structure.

## Step-by-step solution:
1. The issue is that the `translation-links` div is outside of the `translation-content` div, causing the button to be positioned incorrectly.
2. I'll move the `translation-links` div inside the `translation-content` div, similar to how it's structured in the Heroes of Hammerwatch II card.
3. This will ensure proper alignment and styling consistency across all cards.

Fix the HTML structure of the Battle Talent card so the "View Game on Steam" button is properly positioned.

                            <div class="translation-links">

                        </div>
                    </div>
// ...existing code...
````

This change properly nests the `translation-links` div within the `translation-content` div, which will fix the alignment issue and make the button display consistently with other similar buttons on the page.
