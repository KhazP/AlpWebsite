# Can we have the show more buttons only for mobile  (2025-04-16 11:18Z)

_**User (2025-04-16 11:21Z)**_

Can we have the show more buttons only for mobile device and not for desktop/pc/ipad?

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I can do that. This can be achieved using CSS media queries. I will modify the `styles.css` file to hide the "Show More" button container on screens wider than a typical mobile breakpoint (e.g., 768px).


````
/* ...existing code... */

/* --- Project Grid & Cards --- */
/* ...existing code... */

.hidden-project {
    display: none; /* Initially hide projects marked as hidden */
}

.show-more-container {
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 20px;
    /* Initially visible on mobile */
    display: block;
}

.show-more-btn {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    cursor: pointer;
    /* Add other button styles as needed */
}

/* Hide the show more button container on larger screens */
@media (min-width: 769px) { /* Adjust breakpoint as needed */
    .show-more-container {
        display: none;
    }

    /* Ensure all projects are visible on larger screens */
    .project-card.hidden-project {
        display: flex; /* Or block, depending on your card layout */
    }
}

/* ...existing code... */

````
OK. I've added CSS rules to `styles.css`.

On screens wider than 768px (tablets and desktops), the "Show More" button container will now be hidden, and all project cards (including those initially marked as hidden) will be displayed. On smaller screens (mobile), the button will remain visible and functional as before.

@websearch  are there any sensitive info in my code that I should add to Cloudflare Secrets Store? The website is hosted on cloudflare pages

---

_**Assistant**_

The provided code snippet contains a Google Analytics Measurement ID (`G-4J01ZWL5BJ`). This ID is not considered sensitive information. It is designed to be publicly visible in your website's HTML source code to allow Google Analytics to track visitors.

Cloudflare Secrets Store is typically used for storing truly sensitive data like API keys, database passwords, or other credentials that should never be exposed client-side.

Therefore, you do not need to add this Google Analytics ID to the Cloudflare Secrets Store.

What about the rest of the code?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the search results, the other items that might seem like sensitive information are:

1.  **Web3Forms Access Key:** Found in `index.html` (line 764):
    ```html
    // filepath: c:\Users\alpya\Documents\GitHub\AlpWebsite\index.html
    <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="f592ab44-0b05-47b0-919b-4b2b62efe706">
    ```
    This key is necessary for the Web3Forms service to link the form submission to your account. It is designed to be included directly in your public HTML form and is **not considered a secret** that needs protection in the Secrets Store. Web3Forms relies on other methods (like CAPTCHA and their backend processing) to handle security and spam prevention.

2.  **hCaptcha Site Key:** Found in `index.html` (line 790):
    ```html
    // filepath: c:\Users\alpya\Documents\GitHub\AlpWebsite\index.html
    <div class="h-captcha" data-captcha="true" data-sitekey="8a56cbe6-4354-4354-859a-be7663ac498e"></div>
    ```
    Similar to the Web3Forms key, the hCaptcha **site key** is designed to be public. It's required in your HTML to display the CAPTCHA widget on your site. The corresponding hCaptcha *secret* key (used for server-side verification, which Web3Forms handles in this case) is the sensitive part, and it is correctly **not** present in your client-side code.

Therefore, neither the Web3Forms access key nor the hCaptcha site key needs to be moved to the Cloudflare Secrets Store. They are intended for public visibility in the frontend code.

The other search results point to usage of these services in `scripts.js` and `README.md`, or are unrelated content like CSS animations, text content from your case studies/summary documents, or LinkedIn data export files which are not part of the website's active code credentials.
