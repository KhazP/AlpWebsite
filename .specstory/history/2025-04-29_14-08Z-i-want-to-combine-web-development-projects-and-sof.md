# I want to combine Web Development Projects and Sof (2025-04-29 14:08Z)

_**User (2025-04-29 14:28Z)**_

I want to combine Web Development Projects and Software & AI Projects to make translation work stand out more. Please combine those two in a single category titles as Other Projects, and make them stand out less than translations.

_**Assistant**_

I'll combine the "Web Development Projects" and "Software & AI Projects" sections into a single collapsible "Other Projects" section to make your translation work stand out more.

Looking at the current structure, I notice you've already started implementing this change. Let me review the changes and ensure everything's properly set up.

Looking at the current code, I need to:

1. Fix the navigation link to point to `#other-projects` instead of `#web-dev-projects`
2. Ensure the collapsible section is properly set up with the correct styling

Let me make these changes:
```

```


Now that I've updated the navigation links, I need to make sure the footer links are also updated:
```

```


Now I'll create the new "Other Projects" section by replacing the existing separate sections. I'll make this a collapsible section that comes after the "Translations" section:

Now I'll implement the combined "Other Projects" section as a collapsible section. First, I'll check if the section exists:



I need to add the combined "Other Projects" section and remove the original sections. Let me proceed with this change:
```

```


Perfect! I've successfully combined the "Web Development Projects" and "Software & AI Projects" sections into a single collapsible section titled "Other Projects". This reorganization makes your translation work stand out more prominently on your portfolio website.

Here's a summary of the changes I've made:

1. **Updated Navigation Links**: Changed the navigation items in both header and footer to point to `#other-projects` instead of `#web-dev-projects` and labeled them as "Other Projects" (with Turkish translation "DiÄŸer Projeler").

2. **Created a Collapsible Section**: The new "Other Projects" section is a collapsible section that starts in a collapsed state, making it less visually prominent than the "Translations" section.

3. **Combined All Projects**: All six projects (three web development projects and three software/AI projects) are now contained within a single grid in the "Other Projects" section.

4. **Maintained Show More Functionality**: The first four projects are shown initially, while the last two remain hidden until the user clicks "Show More" (just like in the original design).

5. **Removed Original Sections**: Removed the original separate "Web Development Projects" and "Software & AI Projects" sections.

The new structure gives your translation work more visual prominence while still keeping all your other projects well-organized and accessible. Visitors will first see your translation work, and then can click to expand the "Other Projects" section if they're interested in your web development or software projects.

Ok can you also do this visually on the frontend

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the CSS to make the styling reflect the change in priorities, ensuring the "Other Projects" section is visually less prominent than the "Translations" section. This will involve styling the collapsible section and adjusting the visual hierarchy.

Let me make these changes to the CSS:

Let me continue reading the CSS file:



Now let me read about the Projects/Translations section:



Now I have a clear understanding of the CSS structure and how the project sections are styled. Let me make the necessary changes to style the "Other Projects" section to make it visually less prominent than the "Translations" section:
```

```




Now let's add specific styles for the collapsible "Other Projects" section to make it properly appear as less prominent:
```

```






Let's also add specific media queries to make sure the collapsible sections work well on different screen sizes:
```

```






Now let's update the JavaScript to ensure that the collapsible section for "Other Projects" works correctly:





Let me search for the code that handles collapsible sections:





Let me continue reading the JavaScript file to find the relevant sections:







Let me continue reading to find the collapsible sections code:









Let's continue searching for project toggles:









Let me continue looking for the code that handles the "Show More" button:







Found the code that handles the "Show More/Less Projects" toggle. Let me read the rest of the script:



Now I have all the information I need. Let me implement the final JavaScript changes to ensure the collapsible section works properly for the "Other Projects" section:
```

```




Perfect! I've successfully made all the necessary changes to make the "Other Projects" section visually less prominent than the "Translations" section. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

1. **Updated the CSS Styling**:
   - Made the "Other Projects" section use a more subdued color scheme with lower contrast
   - Reduced the size and prominence of headings and text
   - Used more transparent backgrounds for project cards
   - Made the project features (tags) more subtle
   - Added specific styling for the collapsible "Other Projects" section
   - Ensured the "Translations" section looks more prominent with bolder colors and larger elements

2. **Collapsible Section Implementation**:
   - Customized the collapsible section styling specifically for the "Other Projects" section
   - Made it collapsed by default when the page loads
   - Added proper spacing and visual styling to make it look secondary

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Enhanced the grid layout for larger screens (2 columns)
   - Made translation cards stand out more on larger screens

4. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Updated the JavaScript to ensure the "Other Projects" section starts in a collapsed state
   - Maintained compatibility with the existing "Show More" functionality for projects within the section

These changes work together to create a visual hierarchy where:
1. Your "Translations" work stands out as the primary focus
2. The "Other Projects" section is visually de-emphasized and starts in a collapsed state
3. Users can still easily access your other projects by expanding the section when interested

The implementation maintains full functionality while achieving the visual prominence you requested for your translation work.

I don't see a difference?

_**Assistant**_

I'll make sure the visual changes are properly applied. Looking at the current state, it seems that while we've made all the necessary code changes to combine the Web Development Projects and Software & AI Projects into a single "Other Projects" section, the visual changes might not be apparent enough.

Let me take a few additional steps to make the changes more visually noticeable:

Let me make some additional adjustments to ensure the "Other Projects" section is visually less prominent than the "Translations" section:

1. First, let's enhance the styling for the translation cards to make them stand out even more:
```

```




2. Now, let's enhance the translation cards to make them more prominent:
```

```






3. Let's make the "Other Projects" section's header have a more muted appearance, and make sure it stays collapsed by default:
```

```









4. Let's ensure we're properly setting the collapsed state for the Other Projects section on page load:
```

```








5. Let's add some more visual separation between the Translations and Other Projects sections:
```

```








6. Let's enhance the visual styling of the sections to create stronger contrast:
```

```








7. Finally, let's add a subtle separator between the sections:
```

```








Now let's refresh the page to see the changes:







The changes I've made should now be clearly visible. Here's a summary of the
