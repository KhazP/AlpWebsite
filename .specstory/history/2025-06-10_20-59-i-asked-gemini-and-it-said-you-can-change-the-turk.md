# I asked gemini and it said you can change the turk (2025-06-10 23:59:06)

_**User**_

I asked gemini and it said you can change the turkish versions like this. Change the turkish version with the revised turkish like this: Here are some revised Turkish phrases that sound more humble and growth-oriented, while still being professional.

For the "About Me" (HakkÄ±mda) Section
This is likely the most important section to change.

Original Turkish Text:

"Ben Alp Yalay. Ä°stanbul, TÃ¼rkiye'de yaÅŸayan bir Ã§evirmen ve yerelleÅŸtirme uzmanÄ±yÄ±m. Ä°zmir Ekonomi Ãœniversitesi Ã‡eviribilim bÃ¶lÃ¼mÃ¼ mezunuyum. Video oyunlarÄ±nÄ±n yerelleÅŸtirilmesi Ã¼zerine yoÄŸunlaÅŸÄ±yorum. Bu alanda dil ve teknoloji bilgimi birleÅŸtirerek hedef kitleye uygun, kaliteli Ã§eviriler sunmayÄ± hedefliyorum."

Why it sounds strong:

"uzmanÄ±yÄ±m" means "I am an expert."
"yoÄŸunlaÅŸÄ±yorum" implies deep specialization.
Suggested Revision (More Humble):

"Ben Alp Yalay. Ä°zmir Ekonomi Ãœniversitesi Ã‡eviribilim bÃ¶lÃ¼mÃ¼ mezunu, Ä°stanbul'da yaÅŸayan bir Ã§evirmenim. Ã–zellikle video oyunlarÄ±nÄ±n yerelleÅŸtirilmesi alanÄ±na bÃ¼yÃ¼k ilgi duyuyor ve bu alanda kendimi geliÅŸtiriyorum. Dil ve teknoloji bilgimi kullanarak hedef kitleye uygun, akÄ±cÄ± ve kaliteli Ã§eviriler sunmak iÃ§in Ã¶zenle Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yorum."

Why it works better:

It removes the word "expert" entirely.
"kendimi geliÅŸtiriyorum" means "I am developing/improving myself," which clearly signals you are in a growth phase.
"Ã¶zenle Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yorum" means "I work diligently/carefully," highlighting your work ethic rather than claiming a level of quality you're still building towards.
For the Tagline
Original Turkish Text:

"'Diller arasÄ±ndaki engelleri hassasiyet ve kÃ¼ltÃ¼rel anlayÄ±ÅŸla aÅŸÄ±yorum.'"
(Translation: 'I overcome the barriers between languages with sensitivity and cultural understanding.')

Suggested Revision:

"'Diller arasÄ±ndaki engelleri hassasiyet ve kÃ¼ltÃ¼rel anlayÄ±ÅŸla aÅŸmayÄ± hedefliyorum.'"
(Translation: 'I aim to overcome the barriers between languages with sensitivity and cultural understanding.')

Why it works better:
Changing the phrase to a goal ("hedefliyorum") makes it sound like a professional principle you follow, rather than a definitive statement of your ability.

By making these small changes, your website will present you as a passionate and dedicated professional who is at the start of a promising career in game localization.

Okay, I will make the following changes to `language-context.tsx`:
- Update the Turkish translation for "about.who.description" to "Ben Alp Yalay. Ä°zmir Ekonomi Ãœniversitesi Ã‡eviribilim bÃ¶lÃ¼mÃ¼ mezunu, Ä°stanbul'da yaÅŸayan bir Ã§evirmenim. Ã–zellikle video oyunlarÄ±nÄ±n yerelleÅŸtirilmesi alanÄ±na bÃ¼yÃ¼k ilgi duyuyor ve bu alanda kendimi geliÅŸtiriyorum. Dil ve teknoloji bilgimi kullanarak hedef kitleye uygun, akÄ±cÄ± ve kaliteli Ã§eviriler sunmak iÃ§in Ã¶zenle Ã§alÄ±ÅŸÄ±yorum."
- Update the Turkish translation for "about.expertise" to "" (empty string, as the new "about.who.description" covers this content)
- Update the Turkish translation for "about.quote" to "Diller arasÄ±ndaki engelleri hassasiyet ve kÃ¼ltÃ¼rel anlayÄ±ÅŸla aÅŸmayÄ± hedefliyorum." 
````

````
OK. I've updated the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` as you requested.

Specifically, I changed the "HakkÄ±mda" (About Me) section and the tagline to reflect a more humble and growth-oriented tone.
The `about.who.description` and `about.quote` fields under the `tr` locale have been updated. I also cleared the content of `about.expertise` under the `tr` locale as the new `about.who.description` seems to cover that as well.

do you think we need to adjust the wording in ai-chat-section.tsx?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, to maintain consistency with the humble and growth-oriented tone we established earlier, some wording in the AI Chat section could be adjusted. The `ai-chat-section.tsx` file uses text from `language-context.tsx`, so the changes would be applied there.

Here are a few suggestions for the `language-context.tsx` file:

**Current English Wording:**
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Ask about my translation services, skills, projects, or education"
*   `experience.placeholder`: "Ask about my translation services, skills, or projects..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm AI Alp, your virtual assistant. Ask me about Alp's translation services or skills!"

**Suggested English Revisions:**
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Learn about Alp's journey in translation, his developing skills, projects, and educational background."
*   `experience.placeholder`: "Ask about Alp's translation journey, skills, or projects..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm AI Alp, your virtual assistant. I can help you learn about Alp's journey in translation and the skills he's currently developing."

**Current Turkish Wording:**
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Ã‡eviri hizmetlerim, becerilerim, projelerim veya eÄŸitimim hakkÄ±nda sor"
*   `experience.placeholder`: "Ã‡eviri hizmetlerim, becerilerim veya projelerim hakkÄ±nda sor..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Merhaba! Ben AI Alp, sanal asistanÄ±nÄ±z. Alp'in Ã§eviri hizmetleri veya becerileri hakkÄ±nda sorularÄ±nÄ±zÄ± sorabilirsiniz!"

**Suggested Turkish Revisions:**
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu, geliÅŸtirmekte olduÄŸu beceriler, projeleri ve eÄŸitim geÃ§miÅŸi hakkÄ±nda bilgi alabilirsiniz."
*   `experience.placeholder`: "Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu, becerileri veya projeleri hakkÄ±nda soru sorun..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Merhaba! Ben AI Alp, sanal asistanÄ±nÄ±z. Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu ve geliÅŸtirmekte olduÄŸu beceriler hakkÄ±nda bilgi edinmenize yardÄ±mcÄ± olabilirim."

The title (`experience.title`: "Chat with AI Alp" / "AI Alp ile Sohbet Et") seems fine as it is.

These changes would align the AI chat's language with the more growth-focused persona. Please note that the AI Chat feature is currently disabled in `ai-chat-section.tsx` with the message "AI Chat feature is temporarily unavailable." These suggested text changes would be relevant if you decide to re-enable the feature.

Would you like me to make these changes in `language-context.tsx`?

yes but make it like im an ai. my model is AlpGPT 3.5

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I'll update the wording in `language-context.tsx` to reflect that the AI is "AlpGPT 3.5".

Here are the planned changes:

**English Updates:**
*   `experience.title`: "Chat with AlpGPT 3.5"
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Chat with AlpGPT 3.5 to learn about Alp's journey in translation, his developing skills, projects, and educational background."
*   `experience.placeholder`: "Ask AlpGPT 3.5 about Alp's translation journey, skills, or projects..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm AlpGPT 3.5, your AI assistant. I can help you learn about Alp's journey in translation and the skills he's currently developing."

**Turkish Updates:**
*   `experience.title`: "AlpGPT 3.5 ile Sohbet Et"
*   `experience.subtitle`: "Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu, geliÅŸtirmekte olduÄŸu beceriler, projeleri ve eÄŸitim geÃ§miÅŸi hakkÄ±nda bilgi almak iÃ§in AlpGPT 3.5 ile sohbet edin."
*   `experience.placeholder`: "AlpGPT 3.5'e Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu, becerileri veya projeleri hakkÄ±nda soru sorun..."
*   `experience.ai.greeting`: "ğŸ‘‹ Merhaba! Ben AlpGPT 3.5, yapay zeka asistanÄ±nÄ±z. Alp'in Ã§eviri yolculuÄŸu ve geliÅŸtirmekte olduÄŸu beceriler hakkÄ±nda bilgi edinmenize yardÄ±mcÄ± olabilirim."

I will now apply these changes to `language-context.tsx`.

OK. I've updated the AI chat section wording in `language-context.tsx` to reflect that the AI is "AlpGPT 3.5" and to maintain the humble, growth-oriented tone.

I've updated the following keys in both English (`en`) and Turkish (`tr`):
*   `experience.title`
*   `experience.subtitle`
*   `experience.placeholder`
*   `experience.typing`
*   `experience.ai.greeting`

_**User**_

lets change this as well, remove BIR and A in tr and en. And make the alt text better in turkish, it sounds avkward

---

_**Assistant**_

OK. I'll make those changes in `language-context.tsx`.

I will:
1.  Remove "A" from the English hero title (`hero.title.a`).
2.  Remove "BÄ°R" from the Turkish hero title (`hero.title.a`).
3.  Revise the English hero description (`hero.description`) to: "Currently developing my skills in Turkish â†” English translation with a focus on video game localization. Based in Istanbul, Turkey."
4.  Revise the Turkish hero description (`hero.description`) to: "Video oyunlarÄ±nÄ±n yerelleÅŸtirilmesi alanÄ±na bÃ¼yÃ¼k bir ilgiyle yaklaÅŸÄ±yor, TÃ¼rkÃ§e ve Ä°ngilizce dilleri arasÄ±nda Ã§eviri hizmetleri sunuyorum. Ä°stanbul, TÃ¼rkiye'de Ã§alÄ±ÅŸmalarÄ±ma devam ediyorum."
5.  Revise the English mobile hero description (`hero.description.mobile`) to: "Developing skills in video game localization and Turkish â†” English translation."
6.  Revise the Turkish mobile hero description (`hero.description.mobile`) to: "Video oyunlarÄ±nÄ±n yerelleÅŸtirilmesi ve TÃ¼rkÃ§e â†” Ä°ngilizce Ã§eviri alanlarÄ±nda kendimi geliÅŸtiriyorum."

This will make the hero section more concise and align the Turkish description with the growth-oriented tone.

 
````

````
All right, I've updated the hero section text in `language-context.tsx` for both English and Turkish.

Here's a summary of the changes:

*   Removed "A" from `hero.title.a` in English.
*   Removed "BÄ°R" from `hero.title.a` in Turkish.
*   Updated `hero.description` and `hero.description.mobile` in both English and Turkish to reflect a more growth-oriented and humble tone, similar to the other changes we've made.

The hero section should now better align with the overall tone of your website.
