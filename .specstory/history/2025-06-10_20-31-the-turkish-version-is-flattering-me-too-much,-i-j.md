The turkish version is flattering me too much, I just graduated 4 years ago and I have just entered 1 job after graduating so can you please adjust the turkish translation? It says like im expert in the field im working in. Check the whole website and adjust it please. Im a beginner

I will adjust the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to reflect your current experience level.

Specifically, I will change:
- "Video oyun lokalizasyonunda uzmanlaşmış" to "Video oyun lokalizasyonuna ilgi duyan" or similar, to indicate interest and developing skills rather than expertise.
- "Ana uzmanlık alanım video oyun lokalizasyonudur" to "Video oyun lokalizasyonuna odaklanıyorum" or similar.
- Review and adjust "Genç Sosyal Medya Uzmanı" if it implies more expertise than intended.
- Change "uzmanlaşmış Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirici" to "Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirici" or "Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirme Meraklısı".

This will make the Turkish version of your website more accurately represent your current career stage.

The Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` have been adjusted to better reflect your experience level. I've replaced phrases suggesting expertise with terms that indicate a developing career and strong interest in the field.

I noticed a linting error after applying the changes, but it seems unrelated to the translation modifications and is likely an existing issue in the codebase.

I've reviewed the Turkish translations in the "Skills" and "Case Study" sections of `language-context.tsx` and made further adjustments.

Specifically, I've:
- Modified descriptions in the "Skills" section to be more straightforward and less like "professional" or "specialized" services, focusing on the act of providing the service itself.
- Reworded parts of the "Case Study" introduction and results to emphasize the learning aspect and personal development gained from the project, rather than presenting it as a purely professional achievement. Phrases like "kişisel bir ilgiyle başladığım" (I started out of personal interest) and "önemli bir deneyim oldu" (it was an important experience) are used.
- Adjusted titles like "Sağlamlaştırılmış Kariyer Yolu" (Solidified Career Path) to "Kariyer Yolumun Şekillenmesi" (Shaping of My Career Path) to sound less definitive and more like an ongoing process.
- Softened the language in the case study conclusion to highlight the project as a testament to learning and dedication rather than a definitive professional success.

These changes aim to present your experience in a more modest and learning-focused tone, aligning with your request.

Okay, I've gone through the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` again, this time focusing on rephrasing potentially awkward sentences and improving the overall naturalness of the language.

Here's a summary of the types of changes made:

*   **Sentence Structure:** Some sentences were restructured for better flow and readability in Turkish.
*   **Word Choice:** Certain words were replaced with synonyms that fit the context more naturally or are more commonly used in Turkish. For example, "Teknoloji Yığını" was changed to "Kullandığım Teknolojiler" (Technologies I Use), and "Son Görüşler" to "Son Yazılarım" (My Latest Writings).
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some longer phrases were made more concise without losing their meaning.
*   **Tone Consistency:** Ensured the tone remained consistent with the earlier changes (modest, learning-focused).

The goal was to make the Turkish text sound as if it were written by a native speaker familiar with the nuances of the language, rather than a direct or overly literal translation. I've paid attention to common Turkish expressions and sentence patterns.
