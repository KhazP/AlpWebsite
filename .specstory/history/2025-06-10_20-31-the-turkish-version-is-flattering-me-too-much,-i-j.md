# The turkish version is flattering me too much, I j (2025-06-10 23:31:06)

_**User**_

The turkish version is flattering me too much, I just graduated 4 years ago and I have just entered 1 job after graduating so can you please adjust the turkish translation? It says like im expert in the field im working in. Check the whole website and adjust it please. Im a beginner

_**Assistant**_

I will adjust the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` to reflect your current experience level.

Specifically, I will change:
- "Video oyun lokalizasyonunda uzmanlaşmış" to "Video oyun lokalizasyonuna ilgi duyan" or similar, to indicate interest and developing skills rather than expertise.
- "Ana uzmanlık alanım video oyun lokalizasyonudur" to "Video oyun lokalizasyonuna odaklanıyorum" or similar.
- Review and adjust "Genç Sosyal Medya Uzmanı" if it implies more expertise than intended.
- Change "uzmanlaşmış Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirici" to "Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirici" or "Çevirmen ve Yerelleştirme Meraklısı".

This will make the Turkish version of your website more accurately represent your current career stage.

The Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` have been adjusted to better reflect your experience level. I've replaced phrases suggesting expertise with terms that indicate a developing career and strong interest in the field.

I noticed a linting error after applying the changes, but it seems unrelated to the translation modifications and is likely an existing issue in the codebase.

I've reviewed the Turkish translations in the "Skills" and "Case Study" sections of `language-context.tsx` and made further adjustments.

Specifically, I've:
- Modified descriptions in the "Skills" section to be more straightforward and less like "professional" or "specialized" services, focusing on the act of providing the service itself.
- Reworded parts of the "Case Study" introduction and results to emphasize the learning aspect and personal development gained from the project, rather than presenting it as a purely professional achievement. Phrases like "kişisel bir ilgiyle başladığım" (I started out of personal interest) and "önemli bir deneyim oldu" (it was an important experience) are used.
- Adjusted titles like "Sağlamlaştırılmış Kariyer Yolu" (Solidified Career Path) to "Kariyer Yolumun Şekillenmesi" (Shaping of My Career Path) to sound less definitive and more like an ongoing process.
- Softened the language in the case study conclusion to highlight the project as a testament to learning and dedication rather than a definitive professional success.

These changes aim to present your experience in a more modest and learning-focused tone, aligning with your request.

Okay, I've gone through the Turkish translations in `language-context.tsx` again, this time focusing on rephrasing potentially awkward sentences and improving the overall naturalness of the language.

Here's a summary of the types of changes made:

*   **Sentence Structure:** Some sentences were restructured for better flow and readability in Turkish.
*   **Word Choice:** Certain words were replaced with synonyms that fit the context more naturally or are more commonly used in Turkish. For example, "Teknoloji Yığını" was changed to "Kullandığım Teknolojiler" (Technologies I Use), and "Son Görüşler" to "Son Yazılarım" (My Latest Writings).
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Some longer phrases were made more concise without losing their meaning.
*   **Tone Consistency:** Ensured the tone remained consistent with the earlier changes (modest, learning-focused).

The goal was to make the Turkish text sound as if it were written by a native speaker familiar with the nuances of the language, rather than a direct or overly literal translation. I've paid attention to common Turkish expressions and sentence patterns.

I've reviewed and adjusted the English translations in `language-context.tsx` to ensure they align with the more modest and learning-focused tone we established for the Turkish version.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   **Hero Section:** Phrasing like "Specializing in" has been changed to "I offer... with a focus on" or "Focusing on" to sound less like a declaration of expertise.
*   **About Section:** "My main area of expertise is" changed to "I focus on". The description of your social media role was changed from "managing" to "assisted with managing" and "Junior Social Media Manager" to "Social Media Intern" to better reflect a learning/entry-level role.
*   **Skills Section:** "Professional translation services" and "Specialized translation" were toned down to "Translation services" and "Translation for..." respectively. "Tech Stack" changed to "Technologies I Use". "Adapting content for cultural and regional appropriateness" changed to "Adapting content for cultural and regional relevance".
*   **Projects Section:** "Featured Projects" changed to "My Projects". The subtitle was also made slightly more direct.
*   **Blog Section:** "Latest Insights" changed to "My Latest Articles".
*   **Case Study:**
    *   The introduction now emphasizes that the project was taken out of "personal interest" and helped "develop adaptability, resourcefulness, and a long-term perspective" rather than just being a "crucial first step into professional game localization."
    *   Titles like "The Challenge: Navigating Early Career Localization Hurdles" and "Process & Solution: Adaptability and Continuous Improvement" were rephrased to "The Challenges: Navigating Localization Hurdles Early in My Career" and "My Process & Solutions: Adaptability and Continuous Improvement" to make it more personal.
    *   Descriptions of challenges and solutions were reworded to be more direct and slightly less formal.
    *   The "Results & Impact" section now highlights "personal development" more explicitly.
    *   "Solidified Career Path" changed to "Shaping My Career Path".
    *   "Foundation for Future Projects" changed to "A Stepping Stone for Future Projects".
    *   The conclusion was rephrased to emphasize the project as a "testament to my commitment to proactive learning and dedication" and how it shaped "my approach".

The aim was to ensure both language versions consistently portray your experience as a developing professional who is passionate and dedicated to learning and growing in the field.

The linting error that appeared after the changes seems to be the same one from before and is likely unrelated to these specific text modifications.

build failed on cloudflare pages

_**Assistant**_

The build failed because a module could not be found. The logs indicate the following error:

`Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/chatbot/Chatbot'`

This error originates from the file `ai-chat-section.tsx` (which is used in `page.tsx`). It's trying to import a component from `@/components/chatbot/Chatbot`, but this file or directory doesn't seem to exist at that location in your project structure.

Could you please check the following:
1.  Does the `Chatbot` component exist in your project?
2.  If it exists, is it located at `components/chatbot/Chatbot.tsx` (or a similar file extension like `.js`, `.jsx`)?
3.  Is there a typo in the import statement within `ai-chat-section.tsx`?

If the component was recently moved or deleted, the import path needs to be updated or the component restored. If it's a new component that hasn't been created yet, it will need to be added.

remove it please

I've commented out the import and usage of the `Chatbot` component in `ai-chat-section.tsx`. I've also added a placeholder message "AI Chat feature is temporarily unavailable." where the chatbot was previously rendered. This should resolve the build error.

Please try building your project again.
