_**User**_

this is what another ai did to improve the ui, lets make a new agentic prompt for it, it currently doesnt have the data of the main page, like experience, translations, projects and such. Create a long and detailed agentic prompt for it (I'm trying to make a google material UI for my website).

What the ai did:
feat: Implement MVP HTML structure for alpyalay.org redesign

This commit includes the complete static HTML structure for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the alpyalay.org website redesign.

Key changes:
- Created a single-page layout in index.html.
- Integrated Tailwind CSS via CDN.
- Implemented a responsive header with desktop navigation, a mobile menu button, and a placeholder mobile menu structure.
- Added a full-viewport Hero section with headline, sub-headline, and CTAs.
- Included an "About Me" section with bio, skills (chip-style), and approach placeholders.
- Added a "Featured Projects" section with a responsive grid displaying 4 project cards, each with placeholder image, title, description, tech tags, and links.
- Added a "My Experience" section with placeholders for work history and education.
- Included a "Get In Touch" section with a contact form structure and contact links.
- Added a site footer with copyright information.

All sections are styled using Tailwind CSS classes, adhering to the "Accessible Professionalism with a Tech-Forward Edge" visual concept and drawing inspiration from Material Design for components like cards and buttons.

The HTML structure is now ready for JavaScript implementation for interactivity (mobile menu, smooth scroll, etc.) and content population.

Here is a detailed agentic prompt for an AI tasked with building a Google Material-inspired UI for your website, with full awareness of the need to integrate real data (experience, translations, projects, etc.) from your main page and portfolio:

---

You are a highly capable AI web developer and designer, specializing in modern, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces. Your task is to redesign the alpyalay.org website as a single-page application, using Google Material Design principles and Tailwind CSS for styling. Your goal is to create a professional, tech-forward, and user-friendly experience that effectively showcases Alp Yalay’s skills, experience, and portfolio.

You have access to the following data sources and requirements:

1. **Content Integration**:
   - Pull real data from the main page and portfolio, including:
     - Professional experience (work history, education, certifications)
     - Translation/localization projects (with details, links, and case studies)
     - Featured projects (with images, descriptions, technologies used, and links)
     - Skills and technical proficiencies
     - Personal bio and approach
     - Contact information and social links
   - Ensure all content is up-to-date and accurately reflects Alp Yalay’s expertise and achievements.

2. **UI/UX Requirements**:
   - Use Google Material Design as the primary inspiration for components (cards, buttons, navigation, forms, etc.).
   - Style all elements with Tailwind CSS, leveraging its utility classes for rapid prototyping and responsive design.
   - Prioritize accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
   - Ensure the site is fully responsive, with seamless transitions between desktop and mobile layouts.
   - Implement a sticky header with desktop navigation and a mobile menu (hamburger button and slide-out menu).
   - Use Material-inspired cards for project and experience sections, with hover/focus effects and clear call-to-action buttons.
   - Use chip-style tags for skills and technologies.
   - Include a visually engaging Hero section with a headline, sub-headline, and clear CTAs.
   - Add smooth scrolling and animated transitions for navigation and section reveals.

3. **Section Structure**:
   - **Header**: Logo, navigation links (About, Projects, Experience, Contact), language switcher (if multilingual).
   - **Hero**: Full-viewport intro with headline, sub-headline, and CTAs (e.g., View Portfolio, Get In Touch).
   - **About Me**: Bio, skills (as chips), approach/philosophy, and optionally a profile image.
   - **Featured Projects**: Responsive grid of project cards, each with image, title, description, tech tags, and links to details or external sites.
   - **My Experience**: Timeline or card-based layout for work history, education, and certifications.
   - **Translations/Localizations**: Highlight key translation/localization projects, with links to case studies and details.
   - **Get In Touch**: Contact form (with validation), email/social links, and a brief invitation to connect.
   - **Footer**: Copyright, quick links, and social icons.

4. **Interactivity**:
   - Prepare the HTML structure for future JavaScript enhancements (mobile menu toggle, smooth scroll, form validation, etc.).
   - Use ARIA attributes and roles where appropriate for accessibility.

5. **Visual Identity**:
   - Maintain a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing inspired by Material Design.
   - Use subtle shadows, elevation, and motion to create a sense of depth and interactivity.
   - Ensure all icons (e.g., Font Awesome or Material Icons) are loaded efficiently and used meaningfully.

6. **Documentation & Handoff**:
   - Write clean, well-structured HTML with clear comments for each section.
   - Ensure the codebase is ready for further JavaScript integration and content updates.

**Your output should be a complete, production-ready HTML structure styled with Tailwind CSS, fully populated with real data from Alp Yalay’s portfolio and experience. All placeholder content must be replaced with actual information. The design must be visually polished, accessible, and ready for further development.**
