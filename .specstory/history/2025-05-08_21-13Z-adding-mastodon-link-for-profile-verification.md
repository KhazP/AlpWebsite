# Adding Mastodon link for profile verification (2025-05-08 21:13Z)

_**User (2025-05-08 21:18Z)**_

Copy and paste the code below into the HTML of your website. Then add the address of your website into one of the extra fields on your profile from the "Edit profile" tab and save changes.

<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@alpyalay">Mastodon</a>
Copy
Tip: The link on your website can be invisible. The important part is rel="me" which prevents impersonation on websites with user-generated content. You can even use a link tag in the header of the page instead of a, but the HTML must be accessible without executing JavaScript.

Okay, I will add the Mastodon verification link to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file.

I've added the Mastodon verification link to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file. You can now add your website address to your Mastodon profile.

ok what do I need to do now?

It says: Website verification
Verifying your identity on Mastodon is for everyone. Based on open web standards, now and forever free. All you need is a personal website that people recognize you by. When you link to this website from your profile, we will check that the website links back to your profile and show a visual indicator on it.

You have already added the necessary link to your website's HTML.

The next step is to go to your Mastodon profile:
1.  Click on "Edit profile".
2.  Find one of the "Profile metadata" fields (you can add up to four).
3.  In one of these fields, enter the full URL of your website (e.g., `https://alpyalay.org`).
4.  Save the changes to your Mastodon profile.

Mastodon will then check your website for the `rel="me"` link pointing back to your Mastodon profile. If it finds it, your website link on your Mastodon profile will get a verified checkmark.
