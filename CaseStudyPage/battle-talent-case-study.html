                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project:</strong> Turkish Localization of Battle Talent</li>

                    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> January 2021 - Present (Ongoing)</li>
                    <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Approx. 14,700 words / 86,000 characters (as of April 2025)</li>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This case study details the ongoing Turkish localization project for Battle Talent, a physics-based VR rogue-lite action game developed by CyDream Technologies. Undertaken initially as a personal challenge while completing university studies in Translation & Interpretation, this project served as a crucial first step into the world of professional game localization, demanding adaptability, resourcefulness, and a long-term commitment.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Challenge: Navigating Early Career Localization Hurdles</h2>
                <p>The primary objective was to proactively seek practical game localization experience, applying academic knowledge to a real-world project and demonstrating capability in the field. However, this ambition came with several significant hurdles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indirect Source Text:</strong> The English text used as the source for Turkish translation was itself a non-professional translation from the original Simplified Chinese, introducing a layer of potential ambiguity and requiring careful interpretation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tooling & Workflow Constraints:</strong> The localization process relied entirely on a shared Google Sheet for all translators across different languages. This lacked the robust features of standard CAT tools, making terminology management and consistency tracking difficult, especially in the early stages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Terminology & Consistency:</strong> Establishing appropriate Turkish terminology for unique game concepts (e.g., weapon types like 'Rapier', spell names like 'Abyssal Faith Spell') was challenging due to the lack of established Turkish gaming glossaries or accessible translation memories. Ensuring consistency across the growing text volume (~14.7k words) within the Google Sheet environment required meticulous effort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Testing Environment:</strong> No dedicated developer build was available for testing. Validating translations required waiting for monthly public game updates and then testing playthroughs within the live VR environment â€“ a physically demanding and time-consuming process for a game with a relatively small Turkish player base, limiting feedback opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Formal Guidance:</strong> While the developers were supportive, no formal style guide or glossary was provided initially, requiring proactive establishment of localization standards for Turkish.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Process & Solution: Adaptability and Continuous Improvement</h2>
                <p>Despite the constraints, a pragmatic and evolving workflow was established:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research-Driven Translation:</strong> Each term or string was approached with research, utilizing online dictionaries (Tureng.com), cross-referencing translations in other Turkish-localized games, and occasionally leveraging AI for obscure terms. Translations were entered directly into the shared Google Sheet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal Glossary Development:</strong> A personal glossary was created and maintained to track key terms and ensure consistency, with plans to develop a dedicated terminology management app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-Update LQA:</strong> Following each monthly game update, dedicated time was spent testing the newly added or modified Turkish strings within the VR game itself, identifying and correcting errors or awkward phrasing (post-editing).</li>
                    <li><strong>Leveraging AI for Consistency:</strong> To address the consistency challenges inherent in the spreadsheet-based workflow, a 'Hybrid Translation Methodology' was adopted as Large Language Models became more capable (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro as of April 2025). The entire translation text was periodically fed into the AI, which helped identify potential inconsistencies (e.g., flagging similar source terms translated differently, variations in standard UI phrasing) that were difficult to spot manually in the spreadsheet format, allowing for targeted rectification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community & Developer Communication:</strong> Active participation in the dedicated translator Discord channel facilitated communication with other language translators and the development team for clarifications, bug reporting, and feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> Recognizing the learning curve, older translations were revisited and updated over the years to reflect improved skills, better terminology choices, and a deeper understanding of localization best practices.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Results & Impact: Delivering Value and Fostering Growth</h2>
                <p>The ongoing localization effort has successfully made Battle Talent accessible to its Turkish-speaking audience and yielded significant personal development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility for Turkish Players:</strong> Delivered and maintained a complete Turkish localization, making the VR experience fully accessible and enjoyable for the Turkish-speaking player base. Developer data indicated approximately 84 players were engaging with the game in or near Turkey. While direct feedback was scarce, 5 Steam reviews were posted in Turkish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Developer Relationship:</strong> Trust was established and maintained with CyDream Technologies, who relied on this sole effort for the Turkish market. Communication remained open and positive via Discord.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solidified Career Path:</strong> The project confirmed a passion for game localization and highlighted the need for quality localization in the Turkish market, noting a lack of resources for aspiring localizers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrated Resilience & Adaptability:</strong> Successfully navigating the project's constraints (indirect source text, basic tools, limited testing) showcased problem-solving skills and commitment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundation for Future Projects:</strong> The experience gained provided the confidence and skillset to take on larger, more complex localization projects, such as Heroes of Hammerwatch II. It underscored the importance of devotion to long-term projects involving continuous updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> The project honed skills in technical translation, terminology management, LQA in VR, post-editing, cross-cultural communication (within the translation team), and integrating AI tools effectively into the workflow.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The Battle Talent Turkish localization project stands as a testament to proactive learning and dedication. Overcoming initial challenges related to resources, tools, and testing methodology, this ongoing effort not only delivered a valuable localization for Turkish VR gamers but also provided an invaluable foundation, shaping a dedicated approach to game localization characterized by continuous improvement, adaptability, and a commitment to quality.</p>
